# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This repo contains the result of me working through the book, ["The Ray Tracer Challenge:
A Test Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer"](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracer-Challenge-Test-Driven-Renderer/dp/1680502719/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9PKWGDG8TT44&keywords=the+ray+tracer+challenge&qid=1697901294&sprefix=The+Ray%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-1)
by Jamis Buck.

This is complete up through the end of the book.  The rest will be stuff I want to add
(see the to-do lists below).

The following are improvements I want to make.  Most of the ones relating to patterns come
from the "Putting It Together" section of chapter 10, plus some things that POVRay has that
I want to add.  Once an item is checked, you can assume it's done.

### General To-Dos:

- [ ] Motion blur.
- [X] Antialiasing.
- [ ] Support other image formats?

### To-Dos for Lights:
- [ ] Area lights/soft shadows.
- [ ] Spotlights.

### To-Dos for Cameras:
- [ ] Focal blur.

### To-Dos for Surfaces:
- [ ] Texture mapping.
- [ ] Normal perturbation.
- [ ] Other surfaces (Height fields, SORs, sweeps, etc.)

More to come...
